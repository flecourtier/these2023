	abstract = {Implicitly defined, continuous, differentiable signal representations parameterized by neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering many possible benefits over conventional representations. However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent a signal's spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or Sirens, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze Siren activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how Sirens can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine Sirens with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of Siren functions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on distance fields to exactly impose boundary conditions in physics-informed deep neural networks. The challenges in satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions in meshfree and particle methods are well-known. This issue is also pertinent in the development of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for the solution of partial differential equations. We introduce geometry-aware trial functions in artifical neural networks to improve the training in deep learning for partial differential equations. To this end, we use concepts from constructive solid geometry (R-functions) and generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value potential fields) to construct $\phi$, an approximate distance function to the boundary of a domain. To exactly impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, the trial function is taken as $\phi$ multiplied by the PINN approximation, and its generalization via transfinite interpolation is used to a priori satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential), Neumann (natural), and Robin boundary conditions on complex geometries. In doing so, we eliminate modeling error associated with the satisfaction of boundary conditions in a collocation method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met pointwise in a Ritz method. We present numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems over domains with affine and curved boundaries. Benchmark problems in 1D for linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, and beam bending; and in 2D for the Poisson equation, biharmonic equation, and the nonlinear Eikonal equation are considered. The approach extends to higher dimensions, and we showcase its use by solving a Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions over the 4D hypercube. This study provides a pathway for meshfree analysis to be conducted on the exact geometry without domain discretization.},

	title = {$\phi$-{FEM}: an efficient simulation tool using simple meshes for problems in structure mechanics and heat transfer},
	abstract = {One of the major issues in the computational mechanics is to take into account the geometrical complexity. To overcome this diﬃculty and to avoid the expensive mesh generation, geometrically unﬁtted methods, i.e. the numerical methods using the simple computational meshes that do not ﬁt the boundary of the domain, and/or the internal interfaces, have been widely developed. In the present work, we investigate the performances of an unﬁtted method called $\phi$-FEM that converges optimally and uses classical ﬁnite element spaces so that it can be easily implemented using general FEM libraries. The main idea is to take into account the geometry thanks to a level set function describing the boundary or the interface. Up to now, the $\phi$-FEM approach has been proposed, tested and substantiated mathematically only in some simplest settings: Poisson equation with Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin boundary conditions. Our goal here is to demonstrate its applicability to some more sophisticated governing equations arising in the computational mechanics. We consider the linear elasticity equations accompanied by either pure Dirichlet boundary conditions or by the mixed ones (Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditios co-existing on parts of the boundary), an interface problem (linear elasticity with material coeﬃcients abruptly changing over an internal interface), a model of elastic structures with cracks, and ﬁnally the heat equation. In all these settings, we derive an appropriate variant of $\phi$-FEM and then illustrate it by numerical tests on manufactured solutions. We also compare the accuracy and eﬃciency of $\phi$-FEM with those of the standard ﬁtted FEM on the meshes of similar size, revealing the substantial gains that can be achieved by $\phi$-FEM in both the accuracy and the computational time.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2003.11733},
	abstract = {We present a new finite element method, called $\phi$-FEM, to solve numerically elliptic partial differential equations with natural (Neumann or Robin) boundary conditions using simple computational grids, not fitted to the boundary of the physical domain. The boundary data are taken into account using a level-set function, which is a popular tool to deal with complicated or evolving domains. Our approach belongs to the family of fictitious domain methods (or immersed boundary methods) and is close to recent methods of cutFEM/XFEM type. Contrary to the latter, $\phi$-FEM does not need any non-standard numerical integration on cut mesh elements or on the actual boundary, while assuring the optimal convergence orders with finite elements of any degree and providing reasonably well conditioned discrete problems. In the first version of $\phi$-FEM, only essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions was considered. Here, to deal with natural boundary conditions, we introduce the gradient of the primary solution as an auxiliary variable. This is done only on the mesh cells cut by the boundary, so that the size of the numerical system is only slightly increased. We prove theoretically the optimal convergence of our scheme and a bound on the discrete problem conditioning, independent of the mesh cuts. The numerical experiments confirm these results.},
