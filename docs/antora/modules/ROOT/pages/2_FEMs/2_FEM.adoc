In this section, we will present the standard finite element method. We'll start by presenting some general notions of functional analysis, then explain the general principle of FEM. Then we'll give a few more details on the method and finish by describing the application to the Poisson problem (with Dirichlet condition). For more information, please refer to \cite{quarteroni_methodes_2007} and \cite{noauthor_methodes_nodate}.
